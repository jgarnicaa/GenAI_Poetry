# Data Summary

## Data Origin

- The English poetry dataset comes from [Poetry Foundation Poems](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tgdivy/poetry-foundation-poems), available on *Kaggle*.
- The Spanish poetry dataset was collected using web scraping from [Poemas del Alma](https://www.poemas-del-alma.com). After that, the dataset was uploaded for public use and can be found here: [Spanish poetry dataset | Dataset poemas en espa√±ol](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jgarnicaaza/spanish-poetry-dataset-dataset-poemas-en-espaol).

## Data Load Scripts

- The data is stored in CSV format and can be loaded as shown in the [EDA notebook](https://github.com/jgarnicaa/GenAI_Poetry/blob/main/src/EDA/EDA_ES.ipynb).

### Data Storage Location

- In this project, both raw and cleaned data are stored in an S3 Bucket, which can be accessed here: [Data bucket](https://genaipoetry-bucket.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/files/).
- There are two datasets: one containing Spanish poetry and the other containing English poetry.
